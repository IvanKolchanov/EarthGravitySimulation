## Creative Graphics: 2D/3D Simulation Framework for Images and Objects

Earth Gravity Simulation.
A simple simulation of round objects being affected by gravity with programmed in collision. The conditions of the simulation can only be changed through code.
A menu system can be implemented simularly to The Law Of Gravity simulation - one of my other projects.
